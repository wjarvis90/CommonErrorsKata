# CommonErrorsKata
Stack trace flash card practice

Welcome to our Common Errors Kata. Using this Kata will encourage your sleuthing skills in finding bugs within code and solving them logically. This app should show images of stack traces and give you possible correct answers to choose from. If you choose correctly, you should pass a boolean value of `true` to the answer queue. Otherwise, it should pass `false`.

## Step 1: Fork and Clone the Repo

Make sure you fork this repo and clone it to your local machine so that you can build, run, and edit this project.

## Step 2: Run the App

Check and see if the app is working correctly or not. If not, we need to resolve the issue.

## Step 3: Find the Problem

It looks like, currently, every answer is considered a correct answer. Look for this commented `TODO`:

```csharp
//TODO:  Figure out what is a valid answer.
```

## Step 4: Resolve the Problem

Change the code so that the app works as expected. Once this task is "`TODONE`", delete the `TODO` comment.

## Step 5: Update/Refactor the Code

Even when you pass the correct `true`/`false` to the answer queue, the project is fairly static currently. Update the project to support adding, deleting, or changing the error images provided.

## Step 6: Submit a Pull Request

Once your code is working properly, push your code to your forked repo and submit a pull request.

Good luck!
